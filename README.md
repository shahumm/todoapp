# **ðŸŽ‰ Celebratory Todo App**

I rely heavily on todo lists, but I often felt that the simple checkbox didnâ€™t give me enough dopamine or feeling of accomplishment that would possibly encourage me to complete even more tasks. So, I built myself a todo app that extends the satisfying check animation by actually celebrating every tap or effort in hindsight!
